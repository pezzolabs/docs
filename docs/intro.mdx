## Pezzo is for everyone
Whether you are a technical person or a stakeholder, you can use Pezzo effectively. **We don't believe that AI prompts should be designed in a developer's code editor**. Aside from teh technical issues with this approach, it blocks productivity.

With the rise of AI, this is an exciting opportunity for non-technical stakeholders to be at the spearhead of AI development for their products. Pezzo makes this possible.
