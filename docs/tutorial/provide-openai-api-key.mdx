# Step 2: Provider API Key (Optional)

In order to use the built-in prompt tester (as shown later in the tutorial), you'll need to provide your OpenAI API key.

We understand that some users may not want to provide their API key, so this step is optional.

## Provider API Keys
Navigate to the "Provider API Keys" tab in the sidebar. You should see a screen like this:

<img src={ProviderApiKeysImg} />

Here, you can enter your OpenAI API key. Make sure to save. You're ready to continue!
