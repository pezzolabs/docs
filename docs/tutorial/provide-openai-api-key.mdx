# Step 2: Provider API Key (Optional)

In order to use the built-in prompt tester (as shown later in the tutorial), you'll need to provide your OpenAI API key.

We understand that some users may not want to provide their API key, so this step is optional.

## Provider API Keys
In order to supply a provider API key, you need to navigate to your organization's home page. Then, go to to "API Keys" tab.

Here, you can enter your OpenAI API key. Make sure to save. You're ready to continue!
