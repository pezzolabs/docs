# Step 5: Observability & Insights

Pezzo provides a set of tools to help you monitor and debug your prompts. This includes:
- Detailed execution history for each prompt
- Cost overview
- Useful statistics such as number of executions, average execution duration, costs etc.

:::tip
**Have an idea?**
We are always looking to improve Pezzo.

Do you have an idea for a useful metric or graph to display? Perhaps a detail that is missing from the execution history?

Please let us know by creating an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/pezzolabs/pezzo).

## Dashboard
Immediately after selecting a prompt, you will see the **Dashboard** view. Here, you can see useful stats about your prompt.

<img src={DashboardImg} />


## Execution history
Select your prompt and head over to the **History** tab. You will see something like this:

<img src={HistoryTabImg} />

You can inspect each execution by clicking the **Inspect** (magnifying glass) icon, as shown below:

<img src={InspectImg} style={{ maxWidth: 500 }} />

This is extremely powerful. Pezzo helps you understand exactly what went wrong, where and when. You can even tweak the request retroactively and re-run the prompt to see if your changes fix an issue.
